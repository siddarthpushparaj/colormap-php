Description
-------------------

Colormap provides helper methods to convert colors between different formats used on the web. Supported formats are:

 * Six-character hexadecimal (eg, `#000000`)
 * Three-character hexadecimal (eg, `#000`)
 * RGB (eg, `rgb(0,0,0)`)
 * HTML named color, including non-W3C colors (eg, `black`)

Three character hex codes are normalized to six characters and all input is normalized to lowercase. Colors can be converted from any one of these formats to any other.

This library was extracted from [Hextractor](http://hex.corvidworks.com/).


Usage
-------------------

Include class and instantiate a ColorMap object:

	include_once "colormap.php";
	$map = new ColorMap();

Call various methods, as needed:

	$hex  = $map->rgb_to_hex('119 125 66');        // Returns '#777d42'
	$rgb  = $map->hex_to_rgb('#777d42', 'string'); // Returns '119 125 66'
	$name = $map->hex_to_name('#ffffff');          // Returns 'white'
